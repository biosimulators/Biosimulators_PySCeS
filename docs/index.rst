BioSimulators-PySCeS documentation
=====================================

BioSimulators-PySCeS provides a `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org>`_-compliant command-line interface to the `PySCeS <http://pysces.sourceforge.net/>`_ biological simulation tool. A Docker image for this package is also available.

This command-line interface and Docker image enable users to use PySCeS to execute `COMBINE/OMEX archives <https://combinearchive.org/>`_ that describe one or more simulation experiments (in `SED-ML format <https://sed-ml.org>`_) of one or more models (in `SBML format <http://sbml.org>`_).

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by PySCeS is available at `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org/simulators/pysces>`_.

A simple web application and web service for using PySCeS to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at `runBioSimulations <https://run.biosimulations.org>`_.
